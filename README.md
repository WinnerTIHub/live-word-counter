#Live Word Counter

1. enter sentence or paste what you wish to count
2. it would automatically count it based on the words

Note: this doesn't count spaces it just counts the words only!

main focus at the moment wasn't responsiveness but functionality so i optimized for just full desktop screen 1300px and 600px screen below anything otherwise the elements won't be aligned correctly but I'll fix this soon.
